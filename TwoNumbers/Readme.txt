Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers and displays “The two numbers you entered  are:  “, followed by the two numbers on the screen.  

Next , determine the sum,  difference (result of first number minus the second number), product,  and quotient (result of first number divided by the second number), and modulus (remainder of the first number divided by the second number) and print these values to the screen.

Finally, determine the larger of the two integers, and print to the screen “The larger of the two numbers is:  “, followed by the larger integer.   If the two numbers are equal, print “The two numbers are equal.”
