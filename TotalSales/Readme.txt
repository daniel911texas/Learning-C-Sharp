Technical Requirements:

Prompt the user to enter the salesperson’s name, and store this name in a variable.

Prompt the user to enter an item number and a quantity sold of that item.  Store these two entries in two separate variables called “intItem” and “intQuantity”.

Using a DO-WHILE control structure, loop until the user enters -1 for the item number.

Calculate the amount of sales for an item and store the result in a variable called dblItemSales.

After the user enters an item number and a quantity, print to the screen:   the salesperson’s name “has sold “ [intQuantity] “of item # [intItem].

Accumulate the total sales in a variable called dblTotalSales by using a SWITCH statement to select the correct value to be multiplied by the quantity sold and adding this result to a running total, which is stored in the variable dblTotalSales.

If the user enters a number other than 1, 2, 3, or 4, display the message “Invalid Entry” and re-prompt the user to enter an Item Number.  Make sure you do not perform any calculations or prompt the user to enter a quantity if the item number is incorrect.

After accumulating the total sales for an employee (that is, after the user has entered a -1 to quit), print to the screen [Salesperson’s name] sold [number of items] of item # [ item number].
